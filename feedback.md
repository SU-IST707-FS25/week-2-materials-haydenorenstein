## Problem Breakdown

### Exercise 1 (9/10 = 90.0%)

**Part ex1-part1** (ex1-part1.answer): 4/5 points

_Feedback:_ Good understanding of EDA techniques. You covered summary stats and histograms for numeric data, frequency counts for categorical, and boxplots for relationships. Missing some techniques like scatterplots or ANOVA. Overall, a solid attempt with clear examples.

**Part ex1-part2** (ex1-part2.code): 5/5 points

_Feedback:_ Great job! You generated the data with a categorical column and two numeric columns. You explored the numeric data with 'describe', checked category counts, and used boxplots to explore relationships, aligning well with your prior work.

### Exercise 2 (8/10 = 80.0%)

**Part 2-part1** (2-part1.code): 8/10 points

_Feedback:_ Good attempt! You generated a dataset with 1000 rows, 6 columns, and 5% nulls in non-target columns. Numeric columns have different scales. However, the target column is random, not a noisy function of other columns. Consider improving this aspect.

### Exercise 3 (9/10 = 90.0%)

**Part ex2-part1** (ex2-part1.fill): 4/4 points

_Feedback:_ Great job! You correctly implemented the pipeline with separate processing for numeric and categorical features. You used cross-validation and printed classification metrics. The use of train/test split was extra but didn't affect the main task. Well done!

**Part ex2-part2** (ex2-part2.code): 3/3 points

_Feedback:_ Great job! You correctly replaced LogisticRegression with RandomForestClassifier in the pipeline and called run_classifier with it. The code is consistent with your prior work and meets the exercise requirements. Well done on implementing the changes accurately.

**Part ex2-part3** (ex2-part3.answer): 2/3 points

_Feedback:_ You correctly noted the random nature of the data and the similar F1 scores, but misunderstood which model performed better. Logistic Regression outperformed Random Forest due to the linear nature of the data. Your reasoning on model behavior was partially correct.
